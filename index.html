## Bio

I currently work on building, understanding, and integrating machine learning/artificial intelligent systems.

I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning, intelligent agents, digital health, wearables, signal processing, and understanding brain and body connections.

I completed my PhD work in Neural and Biomedical Engineering with fellowships awarded from the NIH and Grove School of Engineering.
